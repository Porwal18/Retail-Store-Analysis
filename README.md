# Sales Dashboard

The dataset which I have used is the Sales dataset of first 2 quarters of 2015 for a fictional retails organisation, which contains information on products, orders and customers. 

In the report I have created 3 different Dashboards which are linked together to provide the better understanding of the sales of the oragnisation. 

The first Dashboard analyse the sales of products in different categories and sub-categories. It also compares sale and profit of different product sub-categories. We can also see some stats which are also linked with product sub-categories. 

Second Dashboard provides the analysis of sales in different regions in comparison with profits. It also contains different stats  in different region in each customer segment.

Third and last Dashboard is mainly focuses on different stats and timeline of the total sales and profit.
